<p>
  BurbnBot is a reverse-engineered, programmatic interface to the private Instagram API. It allows developers to automate tasks such as logging in, sending messages, media uploads, profile lookups, and more, without relying on the official Instagram SDK.

<p>
  Built with Python and requests, BurbnBot was a part of some of the early <a href="/write-ups/instagram-automation.pdf">Instagram reverse engineering work</a> I did. Note that Instagram makes updates to their private API frequently and I have not maintained the project for many years.
